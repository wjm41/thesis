\chapter{Augmenting Nanomolar High-Throughput Screening with Machine Learning for Lead Optimisation}

Typically, testing a drug candidate involves obtaining a pure sample of the molecule, and then mixing it in solution with the protein target under study to measure its bioactivity via an assay. While necessary for maximum accuracy, compound purification can be time-consuming and costly, particularly for chiral molecules. In collaboration with the London Lab at The Weizmann Institute of Science, we investigated whether we needed compound purification at all for training machine learning bioactivity models by using non-purified compound assays. Focusing on a particular scaffold synthesised with an amide coupling as the final step, we added the acid and amine reactants directly in solution with the protein to obtain an assay reading from the crude reaction mixture. By skipping the purification step, this allowed us to quickly screen a library of < 300 > amines with the same acid in high-throughput which we used to train RF and GP models. Leave-one-out validation on the training data correctly identified false negatives, and a prospective virtual screen of EnamineREAL with the trained models returned top hits with similar potency and better pharmacokinetic properties.
