# Unordered list of interesting papers to add to thesis

- [Modeling the expansion of virtual screening libraries](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/62ea77de00ed9c921a2053e3)
  - Interesting point about false positive hit rate as size of screening library increases
- [MEASURING THE CHEMICAL SPACE COVERED BY DATABASES AND MACHINE-GENERATED MOLECULES](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Yo06F8kfMa1)
  - Some interesting points on diversity of molecules in libraries
- [Iterative computational design and crystallographic screening identifies potent inhibitors targeting the Nsp3 macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2212931120)
  - Super forensic detailed campaign against Mac1, multiple assays and looking at binding interactions/protein states
- [Critical assessment of synthetic accessibility scores in computer-assisted synthesis planning](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00678-z)
  - Structure-based synthetic accessibility score surprisingly robust - adding synthetic accessibility score to the retrosynthesis model did not significantly improve performance
- [Machine learning for small molecule drug discovery in academia and industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667318522000265)
  - Very good general overview of differences in priority between academia and industry on applying and developing ML methods in drug discovery (good to review before interviews)
- [Deep Docking: A Deep Learning Platform for Augmentation of Structure Based Drug Discovery](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.0c00229)
  - Reference for applications section in background
