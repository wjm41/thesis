Much of the research in this thesis was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when I spent a considerable amount of time indoors with my dear housemates Dávid and Eszti. I will be forever grateful for their unwavering friendship, humor, and kindness during some of the most challenging times of my PhD journey.

I would like to thank Marika for always putting a smile on my face and reminding me what is truly important in life.

Lastly, I would like to thank my parents, John and Maureen, for their unconditional love and continual support.
